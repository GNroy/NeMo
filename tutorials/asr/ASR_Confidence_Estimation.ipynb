Introduction to ASR confidence estimation\n","Confidence estimation is a crucial yet sometimes overlooked aspect of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Confidence estimation for ASR is the process of estimating the rate of reliability of the output generated by an ASR system. For an output transcription, confidence estimation answers the question \"how accurate this transcription is\", or \"how likely this  transcription is correct\".\n","\n","Confidence score is the result of confidence estimation. It lies in range from 0 to 1, where zero signals that the confidence estimator is completely unsure, and one indicates that the estimator is confident in the output. Confidence scores are often used to guide downstream processing in ASR applications. For example, in a voice dictation application, a low confidence score could trigger the system to ask the user to repeat the input or to suggest alternative transcriptions.\n","\n","There are several approaches to confidence estimation in ASR, including:\n","\n","1. Acoustic modeling-based methods: These methods use the acoustic model scores to estimate the confidence score. The acoustic model represents the relationship between the acoustic signal and the corresponding linguistic units, and the score reflects the similarity between the observed signal and the predicted model output. Here, the acoustic model can be the ASR model itself (non-trainable methods), or a trainable external estimator, accepting acoustic features or output probabilities and predicting confidence scores.\n","\n","2. Language modeling-based methods: These methods use the language model scores to estimate the confidence score. The language model represents the probability distribution of the sequence of words, and the score reflects the likelihood of the transcription given the language model. \n","\n","3. Combination methods: These methods combine the scores from both the acoustic and language models to estimate the confidence score. This approach can leverage the strengths of both models to achieve more accurate confidence scores.\n","\n","In this introductory tutorial we will cover only the non-trainable acoustic-based methods."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"59100fb9","metadata":{"id":"59100fb9"},"source":["## 1.1.
